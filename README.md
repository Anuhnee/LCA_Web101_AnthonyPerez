# LCA_Web101_AnthonyPerez

This new repo is just my old repo without any of the branches. I didn't quite understand how to effectively git and that caused my old repo to be all sorts of out of wack. Through he process of creating this repo, I managed to learn a lot about git. Albeit, I started creating a new repo at midnight, and there has been some hours of sleep that were missed. I'm just glad this new repo works and I have a more well rounded understanding about git after the creation of the new repo. Anyway, # C'est la vie
